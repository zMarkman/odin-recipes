    <h2>Save scraps. Free broth forever.</h2>
        <p>Money is hard to come by.</p>
        <p>Between rent, food, and having fun on a Friday night with friends, money goes out of your hands quick.</p>
        <p>Come with me on a journey towards financial freedom (or a step on that journey) by way of the magic broth road!</p>
        <p>The secret is <strong>waste</strong>.</p>
        <p>Food waste, that is... which isn't necessarily waste at all!</p>
        <p>Unlike "recycling" which often simply gets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YN7RQgUVEo" target="_blank">set on fire</a>,
        much of your food waste can <em>actually</em> be reused. </p>
        <p>Here's what I do to save money.</p>
        <p>Any time I make a meal using vegetables, which is, you know a decent but not universal amount of time, 
        I save any scraps of root vegetables, mushrooms, garlic, etc. and put them in a ziploc bag in the freezer. </p>
        <p>After awhile the bag gets full. At that point, I dump all the scraps into an Instant Pot, fill it with water to the max fill line,
         then set it to manual for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>This is typically enough time for all the flavorful bits of my frozen scraps to be pressure-cooked into the water.</p>
        <p>Voila! Pour the broth through a strainer to remove the scraps, which you can now dispose of.</p>
        <p>Re-freeze the broth for use whenever you need something more flavorful than water in a recipe.</p>
