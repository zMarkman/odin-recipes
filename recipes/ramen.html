    <h2>Delicious veg ramen made easy.</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to eat a super delicious ramen? <em>You're in luck!</em></p>
    <p>This ramen is <strong>GOATed.</strong></p>
    <p>I came up with this during my vegan days as a way to minimize
         my processed food intake.</p>
    <p>Ask any vegan or vegetarian and they might tell you how hard it
         is to get enough vitamins, minerals, and proteins by only
          eating plants and plant-based products.</p>
    <p>I didn't want to set my money on fire at Whole Foods buying 
        prepared broths or just-add-water cups, so I set out to Google
         my way towards a tasty (and somewhat healthy) homemade dinner.</p>
    <p>The first element of a good ramen is a good dashi, but that has bonito
         fish flakes in it!</p>
    <p>So, I started by searching for a vegetarian dashi and found out that
        you can make one with kombu and/or wakame seaweeds instead! It's not the same
        as fish flakes, but if you use shiitake powder or boil in small pieces of
        sliced shiitake mushrooms you can create a savory base that is animal-free. 
    </p>
    <p>Once the dashi boils, set the water to a simmer and gently sift your miso in.
        I like to use 1tbsp miso per 1cup of water in the dashi with just a few sprinkles
        of wakame and one big piece of kombu which I remove before serving. Kombu is not a 
        part of this dish beyond boiling it for dashi. I also add 0.5 tbsp of sesame oil per 
        1cup water, as well as 1tbsp soy sauce (ideally tamari) per 1cup water. 
    </p>
    <p>Once the broth is simmering, I add in tofu, mushrooms, veggies, and anything else that
        sounds good in a salty soup! Mix together in a ramen bowl with noodles that 
        you boiled separately ahead of time and enjoy!
